tcpdump -c 3 -w has.pcap
tcpdump -c 3 -w has.pcap -vv
tcpdump -c 10 -w has.pcap -vv
tcpdump -i at0 -w has.pcap -vv


## Monitor Nmap scans ##
tcpdump -nn

## View available interfaces
tcpdump -D

## Capture in ascii mode and unlimited package lenght
tcpdump -A -s0

## Write into a file
tcpdump -w file.pcap

## Select the interfaz to sniff
tcpdump -i eth0

## Rubish search
tcpdump ... | grep "somcining" > file

## Rotate Files
tcpdump -i en0 -w /var/tmp/trace -W 48 -G 1800 -C 100

This will rotate files (of names trace1, trace2, ...) cyclically, with period 48, either every 1800 seconds (=30 minutes) or every 100 MB, whichever comes first.

## Capture http and hppts

Sometimes the traffic is buffered or delayed by DNS server responses. To avoid it, add -l and -n parameters.

-l Make stdout line buffered. Useful if you want to see the data while capturing it.

-n Don't convert addresses (i.e., host addresses, port numbers, etc.) to names.

Then you can use syntax like:

sudo tcpdump -i en1 -nl port http or port https
For more complex queries, make sure you use brackets to group the expressions.

## Check DNS resolving
tcpdump -ni any port 53
