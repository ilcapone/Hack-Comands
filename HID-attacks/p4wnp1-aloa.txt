- Add one --> Turn on Enabled --> Trigger: service started --> Action: start a HIDScript --> Script name: the script created before.
- Store the trigger action.
- Go to Generic Settings --> Select the TriggerActions Template created, the USB Templated created with the proper information about the vendor id, product id and serial number, and the WiFi template and others if desired. Store the Master Template.
- In Generic Settings, in the Startup Settings, select the Master Template you just created.
