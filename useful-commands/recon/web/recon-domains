Changed initialrecon.py script to run correctly and changed crtsh_script.py to run with python3 and can execute with more than one domain at same execution on initial
initial script does normal nmaps, dirsearchs, domain retrieve from certs, subdomain retrieve and executes crtsh_script.py that retrieve domains

./initialrecon.py -d {DOMAINS SEPARATED BY ,} -n {NAME OF BUSINESS} -r {PATH TO FILE WITH IPS} -f -o {OUTPUT PATH} --debug

To take more domains
amass intel -whois -d {DOMAIN}
Afther whois command, you will need to check the IPs of these domains found to see if they are in your scope

amass intel -active -cidr {ip}/{cidr} -p 80,443,8080,8443 -ip -r 8.8.4.4,8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1
Careful because it is not showing all the IPs. Diferent results on diferent executions.

For more manual execution 
amass intel -active -addr {ip} -p 80,443,8080,8443 -ip -r 8.8.4.4,8.8    .8.8,1.1.1.1


Reverse IP lookup
cat nmap-*.gnmap | grep Host | grep Up | awk '{print $2}' > ips-from-nmaps.txt
for IP in $(cat ips-from-nmaps.txt); do curl https://api.hackertarget.com/reverseiplookup/?q=$IP >> domains-reverse-lookup.txt; done
