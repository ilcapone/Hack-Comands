To install bloodhound on arch:
sudo pacman -S bloodhound

This will install NEO4J, but the environment variables are incorrectly setted, so you have 2 possibilities, change the $PATH to /usr/share/neo4j/bin/ or do the following things (i prefer the second one)

vim /usr/bin/neo4j
#Add at the top the following lines
NEO4J_HOME=/usr/share/neo4j/bin/
NEO4J_CONF=/etc/neo4j/

vim /etc/neo4j/neo4j.conf
#uncomment or add the following line
dbms.allow_format_migration=true

After that just execute the following commands to start bloodhound:
sudo neo4j console &
sudo bloodhound &
